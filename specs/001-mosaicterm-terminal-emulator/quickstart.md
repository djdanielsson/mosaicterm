# Quickstart Validation: MosaicTerm MVP

**Date**: September 17, 2025
**Purpose**: Define validation scenarios for MosaicTerm MVP functionality

## Primary User Journey Validation

### Scenario: Basic Command Execution
**Given** MosaicTerm is freshly launched
**When** user types `echo "Hello, MosaicTerm!"` and presses Enter
**Then**:
- Command appears in a new block in history
- Output "Hello, MosaicTerm!" displays below command
- Input field clears and remains focused at bottom
- New prompt appears ready for next command

**Success Criteria**:
- Block created within 100ms of Enter press
- Text renders correctly with proper spacing
- Input field maintains focus
- No UI freezing or lag

---

### Scenario: ANSI Color Output
**Given** MosaicTerm is running with zsh
**When** user executes `ls -la --color=always`
**Then**:
- Directory listing appears with proper colors
- Files show in different colors based on type
- ANSI color codes render correctly in block
- Colors match terminal expectations

**Success Criteria**:
- All ANSI color codes (16, 256, 24-bit) supported
- Color rendering matches original terminal output
- Performance impact <5ms per colored line

---

### Scenario: Long Output Scrolling
**Given** MosaicTerm has executed a command with 100+ lines
**When** user scrolls the history area
**Then**:
- Scrolling is smooth at 60fps
- Large output blocks handle scrolling efficiently
- Memory usage remains under 200MB
- UI remains responsive during scroll

**Success Criteria**:
- Scroll performance >55fps consistently
- Memory growth <50MB for 1000-line outputs
- No UI blocking during scroll operations

---

### Scenario: Zsh Integration
**Given** user has Oh My Zsh installed with custom theme
**When** MosaicTerm launches
**Then**:
- Zsh starts with user's ~/.zshrc configuration
- Oh My Zsh theme displays correctly
- Tab completion works as expected
- Custom aliases and functions available

**Success Criteria**:
- No configuration conflicts or errors
- Theme renders identically to standalone zsh
- All zsh features work transparently

---

### Scenario: CLI Tool Integration
**Given** fzf, bat, and rg are installed
**When** user runs:
1. `fd . | fzf`
2. `bat README.md`
3. `rg "TODO"`
**Then**:
- fzf interactive selection works
- bat syntax highlighting displays
- rg search results show with colors
- All tools behave identically to standalone terminal

**Success Criteria**:
- Interactive tools (fzf) work with mouse/keyboard
- Color output preserved for all tools
- Performance matches standalone execution

## Performance Benchmarks

### Startup Performance
- **Target**: <2 seconds from launch to first prompt
- **Measurement**: Time from app start to zsh prompt display
- **Success**: Consistently under 2 seconds on target hardware

### Command Execution Latency
- **Target**: <100ms from Enter to output start
- **Measurement**: Time between Enter press and first output character
- **Success**: 95th percentile under 100ms

### UI Responsiveness
- **Target**: 60fps sustained during scrolling
- **Measurement**: Frame time during active scrolling
- **Success**: >55fps maintained during all operations

### Memory Usage
- **Target**: <200MB for typical usage
- **Measurement**: Peak memory usage during normal operation
- **Success**: Memory usage stays under 200MB

## Error Handling Validation

### Scenario: Command Failure
**Given** user executes a failing command like `nonexistent-command`
**When** command completes
**Then**:
- Error output displays in red/clear formatting
- Exit code information captured
- Block shows failure status
- Next command input still works

**Success Criteria**:
- Error output clearly distinguishable
- No crash or hang on command failure
- Proper error status indication

### Scenario: PTY Process Termination
**Given** PTY process terminates unexpectedly
**When** user attempts next command
**Then**:
- Error message displays clearly
- Application offers restart option
- No data loss for existing blocks
- Graceful recovery process

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear error communication to user
- Recovery without data loss
- No application crash

## Cross-Platform Validation

### macOS Specific
- Native window behavior (close, minimize, fullscreen)
- Menu bar integration
- Copy/paste with Cmd+C/Cmd+V
- Font rendering quality

### Linux Specific (Future)
- Window manager integration
- System tray support
- Native file dialogs
- Distribution-specific package management

### Windows Specific (Future)
- PowerShell integration
- WSL support
- Windows console compatibility
- Native window styling

## Accessibility Validation

### Keyboard Navigation
- Tab navigation between UI elements
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support

### Visual Accessibility
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Scalable text and UI elements
- Color-blind friendly color schemes
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation

## Integration Test Scenarios

### Complete User Workflow
1. Launch application
2. Execute basic commands
3. Use shell features (completion, history)
4. Run CLI tools with interactive features
5. Scroll through history
6. Copy output from blocks
7. Execute complex multi-line commands
8. Exit application cleanly

### Recovery Scenarios
1. Network interruption during command execution
2. System sleep/wake during active session
3. External process termination
4. Configuration file corruption
5. Font or display changes
