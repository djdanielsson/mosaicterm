# MosaicTerm System Contracts

This directory contains the system contracts that define the interfaces and behaviors for MosaicTerm components.

## Contract Categories

### PTY Management Contracts
- `pty-lifecycle.md` - PTY creation, management, and termination
- `command-execution.md` - Command input/output streaming
- `process-management.md` - Process lifecycle and cleanup

### UI Rendering Contracts
- `block-rendering.md` - Command block display and ANSI color support
- `scroll-management.md` - History area scrolling and navigation
- `input-handling.md` - Input prompt positioning and focus management

### Command Processing Contracts
- `command-parsing.md` - Command validation and parsing
- `output-segmentation.md` - Output capture and block creation
- `prompt-detection.md` - Shell prompt detection and completion signaling

## Contract Testing
Each contract should have corresponding failing tests in the `/tests/contract/` directory that will be implemented during Phase 3.

## Development Notes
- Contracts are written from the perspective of the consumer (what the system provides)
- All contracts must be testable and verifiable
- Contracts should be implementation-agnostic (no specific tech details)
- Breaking changes to contracts require updating dependent contracts and tests
