# Tasks: MosaicTerm Terminal Emulator

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-mosaicterm-terminal-emulator/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: Rust + egui + portable-pty tech stack
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task [P]
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (TDD FIRST)
   → Core: models, services, PTY, terminal logic
   → Integration: UI components, ANSI processing
   → Polish: performance, documentation, validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies & Blocking Relationships

### Test Dependencies (TDD Order)
- T007-T013 (contract/integration tests) block T014-T044 (all implementation)
- Tests must be written and failing before ANY implementation begins

### Implementation Dependencies
- T014-T019 (models) block T020-T044 (services and UI)
- T020-T024 (PTY) block T025-T030 (terminal logic)
- T031-T036 (UI components) block T041-T044 (integration)
- T037-T040 (config) can run in parallel with other components

### Phase 4 Dependencies (Application Launch)
- T055-T060 (Application Launch) block T061-T078 (all Phase 4 tasks)
- T061-T066 (Core Terminal Ops) can run in parallel with T067-T072 (UI Refinement)
- T073-T078 (Advanced Features) depend on T055-T072 completion

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
**Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T006 can run in parallel
**Test Phase**: T007-T013 are all independent contract/integration tests
**Model Phase**: T014-T019 are all independent model definitions
**Component Phases**: Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

### Phase 4 Parallel Execution
**Application Launch**: T056-T060 can run in parallel after T055
**Core Terminal Ops**: T062-T066 can run in parallel after T061
**UI Refinement**: T068-T072 can run in parallel after T067
**Advanced Features**: T074-T078 can run in parallel after T073

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- TDD order strictly enforced: Tests before implementation
- Commit after each task completion
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, implementation without tests

## Current Status Summary
- ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: All infrastructure, core components, and integration completed
- 🎯 **Phase 4 Active**: Application Launch & Basic UI phase ready for implementation
- 📊 **Test Coverage**: 226/232 tests passing (97.4% success rate)
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: Complete modular design with PTY, terminal, UI, and state management
- 🎨 **MosaicTerm Vision**: Block-based command history with pinned input prompt

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Data Model**: Each entity (T014-T019) → model creation task [P]
2. **From Contracts**: Each contract file (T007-T009) → contract test task [P]
3. **From User Stories**: Each scenario (T010-T013) → integration test [P]
4. **From Phase 4 Plan**: Application launch → Core operations → UI polish → Advanced features
5. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → UI → Integration → Polish → Launch
6. **Dependencies**: Clear blocking relationships defined for Phase 4
7. **Parallelization**: Independent tasks marked [P] for concurrent execution

## Phase 4 Implementation Strategy
1. **Start with T055**: Get basic window appearing first
2. **Parallel Execution**: T056-T060 can run simultaneously after T055
3. **Core Functionality**: T061-T066 enable basic terminal operations
4. **UI Polish**: T067-T072 improve user experience
5. **Advanced Features**: T073-T078 add robustness and sophistication
6. **MVP Focus**: Prioritize launch → basic I/O → UI polish over advanced features
