# Feature Specification: mosaicterm

**Feature Branch**: `001-mosaicterm-terminal-emulator`
**Created**: September 17, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "name: mosaicterm
version: 0.1.0
description: |
  A Rust GUI terminal emulator inspired by Warp.
  - MVP target: macOS
  - Future goal: cross-platform (Linux, Windows).
  - Key differentiator: commands and outputs are grouped into discrete "blocks" with a permanently pinned prompt at the bottom.

goals:
  - Run zsh (with Oh My Zsh, plugins, themes, completions, fzf, etc.) inside a PTY.
  - Capture stdout/stderr from the PTY and segment them into blocks (command + output).
  - Always render the prompt at the bottom of the window (fixed input field).
  - Display past blocks in a scrollable history panel.
  - Support ANSI color + escape codes (zsh prompts, bat, fzf).
  - Mac MVP must feel native (fonts, scrolling, copy/paste).
  - Long-term: support Linux/Windows shells with minimal changes.

non_goals:
  - Reimplementing zsh or fzf functionality.
  - Writing a new shell or autocomplete system.
  - Full plugin system in MVP (stretch goal).
  - Remote shell support (SSH) in MVP.

requirements:
  environment:
    - Rust stable toolchain (latest).
    - macOS 14+ for MVP.
    - Installed dependencies: zsh, fzf, eza, bat, rg, fd, jq, Oh My Zsh.
  dependencies:
    - GUI: `egui` (with `eframe` for window management).
    - PTY: `portable-pty`.
    - ANSI/escape code parsing: `vte`.
    - Syntax highlighting: `syntect` (future).
    - Config: `serde` + `toml` for settings file.
  design:
    - Main window split into two regions:
      - Scrollable "history" region (all past blocks).
      - Pinned input prompt at bottom (single-line text box).
    - Each block:
      - Command string (rendered as header).
      - Output area (scrollable if long, supports ANSI colors).
    - Block actions (future): collapse, copy, re-run.
  mvp_features:
    - Start zsh in PTY when app launches.
    - Capture prompt detection (use PS1 marker or heuristic).
    - When user presses Enter in bottom input box:
      - Send command string to PTY.
      - Collect output until next prompt.
      - Render new block in history area.
    - Keep bottom input field empty and focused.
    - Handle ANSI output correctly (colored ls, bat).
  stretch_features:
    - Block re-run (send old command again).
    - Inline search/filter for past blocks.
    - GUI buttons to trigger common commands (fd | fzf, rg, bat).
    - Configurable themes for blocks (JSON/TOML config).
    - Export block history to markdown.
  cross_platform_plan:
    - Linux: same approach, run user's default shell inside PTY.
    - Windows: support PowerShell/WSL via PTY integration.
    - Abstract PTY handling into platform module to swap backends.

success_criteria:
  - On macOS, user can launch app, run commands inside zsh, see output grouped into blocks, and always have prompt pinned at bottom.
  - ANSI output (colors, cursor moves) renders correctly.
  - Scrolling through history feels smooth.
  - User's existing zsh config (Oh My Zsh, fzf, completions) works transparently."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer who uses zsh with Oh My Zsh and various CLI tools, I want a modern terminal emulator that groups commands and their outputs into discrete, scrollable blocks while keeping a permanently pinned input prompt at the bottom, so I can easily review command history and maintain a clean, organized terminal experience similar to Warp but running my existing zsh setup transparently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is launched on macOS, **When** the user opens mosaicterm, **Then** zsh starts in a PTY with the user's existing configuration and displays a pinned input prompt at the bottom
2. **Given** zsh is running with a prompt visible, **When** the user types a command and presses Enter, **Then** the command is sent to the PTY, output is captured until the next prompt, and a new block appears in the history showing the command and its output
3. **Given** a command produces colored ANSI output (like `ls` with colors or `bat` syntax highlighting), **When** the command executes, **Then** the colors and formatting are preserved and rendered correctly in the output block
4. **Given** multiple commands have been executed creating several blocks, **When** the user scrolls the history region, **Then** all past blocks remain visible and scroll smoothly
5. **Given** the input field is empty and focused, **When** the user types a new command, **Then** the bottom input field remains pinned and ready for the next command

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a command produces very long output that exceeds the visible area?
- How does the system handle commands that don't produce output (like background processes)?
- What happens when zsh plugins or completions modify the prompt appearance?
- How does the system detect prompt changes when users customize their PS1?
- What happens when the PTY process terminates unexpectedly?
- How does the system handle commands that take a long time to complete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST start zsh shell in a PTY when the application launches
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a permanently pinned input field at the bottom of the window

- **FR-004**: System MUST send captured input as commands to the running zsh PTY
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture all stdout and stderr output from zsh commands
- **FR-006**: System MUST group each command and its complete output into a discrete block
- **FR-007**: System MUST display blocks in a scrollable history region above the input field
- **FR-008**: System MUST render ANSI color codes and escape sequences correctly in block output
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve and utilize user's existing zsh configuration and plugins

- **FR-012**: System MUST support Oh My Zsh themes, completions, and fzf integration transparently
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide native macOS feel for fonts, scrolling, and copy/paste operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Command Block**: Represents a single executed command and its output, containing command text, output content, timestamp, and display state
- **PTY Session**: Represents the running zsh process and its communication channels for input/output
- **History Panel**: Represents the scrollable collection of command blocks in chronological order
